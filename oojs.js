// #1: Define a `Playlist` class with the following properties:
// - a `title` property that is a string determined by some input (passed into the constructor)
// - a `songs` property that is an empty array not determined by input (not passed into the constructor)
// - an `addSong` method that adds a song (string) to the `songs` array


// // #2: Create an instance of the Playlist class and set it to a variable called `myPlaylist`
// // Call the instance's `addSong` method to add a song to the instance's `songs` array
